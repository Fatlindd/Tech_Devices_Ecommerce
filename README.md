Tech Devices Ecommerce

My project or website, which I realized while holding a training for FrontEnd technologies. In the project I included:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (Responsive)
4. JavaScript
5. jQuery
6. json files

My idea has been to create an e-commerce website, which would contain technological products (devices), the products that the page contains are of the same format and implemented in json files that are fetched as an API with AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. The products have their own prices and can be added to the cart using the buttons on each card created for each product, and which are automatically added from the json file when the website is loaded. The website is responsive only for certain links, and for the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Mini devices, for which I worked.
